# Hand Detection and Safety System

The Hand Detection and Safety System is an artificial intelligence-based solution designed to prevent accidents in industrial settings. The system uses a custom-trained object detection model to identify hands in the frame and draws a boundary line around them. If a worker's hand crosses the line, an alert system is triggered, including a siren and a message indicating that the hand is in danger.

# System Architecture

The Hand Detection and Safety System architecture comprises several key components that work together to detect and prevent accidents in industrial settings. The system architecture consists of the following components:

Camera: A camera captures images or videos of the working area.

Object detection model: An object detection model identifies hands in the captured images or videos.

Boundary line: Once a hand is detected, a boundary line is drawn around it to indicate the hazardous area.

Alert system: An alert system is triggered when a worker's hand crosses the boundary line.

Integration with machinery: The system integrates with industrial machinery to stop the machine when a hand is detected in a hazardous area.



# Usage

To use the Hand Detection and Safety System, follow these steps:

Install the necessary dependencies.

Train the object detection model on a dataset of images containing hands in various positions and orientations.

Connect the camera to the system and adjust its position to capture a clear view of the working area.

Run the system, and it will start monitoring the working area.

If a worker's hand crosses the boundary line, the alert system will be triggered.


# Conclusion
The Hand Detection and Safety System is an effective solution to prevent accidents in industrial settings. By detecting and alerting workers of potential hazards, the system can help reduce the risk of injuries and fatalities.
